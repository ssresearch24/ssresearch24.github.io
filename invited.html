					 <strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Agility By Design: Cryptography for Evolving Ecosystems</p>
					<!-- <strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>The notion of Anamorphic Cryptography has been developed to demonstrate that in existing and well established designs of cryptographic schemes, there is a way for users to exchange secret messages, even when an an authority demands to get/ share the private keys of the receiver and dictates messages to the sender. Namely, even under configurations where the use of Cryptography is strongly controlled by some authority (your enterprise, or agnecy, or even some criminal organization, etc.), there is a way to exploit the system for sending messages secure from the authority by the sender and receiver. This has been demonstrated under a few models and various cryptosystems. The basic notion teaches us that limiting crypto and asking to get the key does not prevent the use of cryptosystems to get secret message that are private and not shared with the authority.</p>

					<h3>Bart Preneel</h3>
					<strong>Biography:</strong>
					<p>Bart Preneel received the Electrical Engineering degree and the Doctorate in Applied Sciences from KU Leuven. He is currently full professor (gewoon hoogleraar) at KU Leuven and heads the COSIC group. He was visiting professor at the Danish Technical University (DTU) (2007), TU Graz (1997-2006), the University of Bergen (1997-2001), Ruhr-Univ.t in Bochum (2001-2002) and at the University of Ghent (1994-2002). He was a scientific advisor at Philips Research in the Netherlands. During the academic year 1993-1994, he was a research fellow of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. His main research interests are cryptology, cybersecurity and privacy.   <br />

He has authored and co-authored more than 400 scientific publications and is an inventor of five patents. He has served as a member of the Editorial Board of five journals and has served as program chair of 20 conferences including Eurocrypt, CHES, FSE, ESORICS and Financial Cryptology. He has been an invited speaker at more than 120 conferences in more than 40 countries. He has testified multiple times for the European Parliament. In 2014 he received the RSA Award for Excellence in the Field of Mathematics, in 2016 he received the Kristian Beckman Award from IFIP TC11 and in 2018 he received the ESORICS Award for Outstanding Research. </p>
					 <strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Black-Box Attacks on Perceptual Hash Functions</p>
					<!-- <strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>Public key cryptosystems (PKC) are the security foundation of modern communication systems, in particular, the Internet. However, Shor's algorithm shows that the existing PKC like Diffie-Hellmann key exchange, RSA and ECC can be broken by a quantum computer. To prepare for the coming age of quantum computing, we need to build new public key cryptosystems that could resist quantum computer attacks. In this lecture, we will give an introduction to post-quantum cryptography and its recent developments, in particular, the NIST standardization process and its impact. Then we will present a practical and provably secure key exchange protocol based on the learning with errors problems, which is conceptually simple and has strong provable security properties. This new construction was established in 2011-2012. We will explain that all the existing LWE-based key exchanges are variants of this fundamental design.</p>

					<h3>Liqun Chen</h3>
					<strong>Biography:</strong>
					<p>Liqun joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of Surrey as Professor in Secure Systems in 2016. Prior to this appointment, she was a Principal Research Scientist at Hewlett Packard Laboratories in Bristol, UK, which she joined in 1997. Before that, she worked at Royal Holloway, University of London, the University of Oxford, and Southeast University in P.R. China. Liqun is a visiting professor at Southeast University. </p>
					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Standardisation of and Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>Recent reports on the timeline of quantum threats suggest that large, scalable quantum computers will likely become a reality in the near future. This impending technological advancement has increased the urgency for standardisation of and migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), making it a critical focus for information and cybersecurity experts. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the current state of standardisation efforts in the field of PQC and explore its implications across various sectors, including industry, academic research, open-source development, and government agencies. Additionally, we will address the gaps and challenges that remain unaddressed within existing standardisation initiatives, offering insights into both the progress that has been made and the areas that require further attention and development.</p>

					<h3>Lily Chen</h3>
					<strong>Biography:</strong>
					<p>Dr. Lily Lidong Chen is a mathematician and NIST fellow. She served as the manager of Cryptographic Technology Group for more than a decade before she was selected as a NIST fellow in 2023. She has led the effort in developing cryptographic standards published in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and NIST Special Publications (SP). She is a pioneer in developing post-quantum cryptography standards and has been actively explored many advanced cryptography areas for standardization. Her research interests include cryptography, network security, and security in communications. Dr. Chen has actively contributed to cryptographic and security standards development by IEEE-SA, ISO, and other standards organizations.  </p>
