<h1>Security Standardisation Research Conference 2024</h1>

<p>
The Security Standardisation Research (SSR) Conference 2024 is the 9th iteration of the SSR conference series, launched in 2014. SSR 2024 will be co-located with <a href="https://inscrypt2024.github.io/">Inscrypt 2024</a> in Kunming, China, and will take place Decemeber 16&ndash;17, 2024.
</p>

<p>
In the past two decades, cybersecurity standards have advanced significantly and many of them have become very widely used. Despite their widespread use, it is essential to continually revise existing standards and develop new standards to cover emerging domains, such as post-quantum cryptography, fully homomorphic encryption, 6G and artificial intelligence. The purpose of the 2024 SSR conference is to discuss the numerous research challenges arising from studies of existing standards, the development of revisions to these standards, and the exploration of entirely new areas of standardization. Many security standards bodies are only beginning to address the issue of transparency, ensuring that the process of selecting security techniques for standardization is as scientific and unbiased as possible.
</p>

<p>
This conference is intended to cover the full spectrum of research on security standardisation, including, but not restricted to, work on cryptographic techniques, security management, security evaluation criteria, security policy, network security, privacy and identity management, smart cards and RFID tags, biometrics, security modules, and industry-specific security standards (e.g. those produced by the payments, telecommunications and computing industries for such things as payment protocols, mobile telephony and trusted computing). Through these discussions and research presentations, the conference aims to advance the field of security standardization, fostering a collaborative environment for both revising existing standards and developing new ones to address the evolving challenges in cybersecurity.
