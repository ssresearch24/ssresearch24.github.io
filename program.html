<h3>Panel Take-Aways</h3>

<p>
The panel on Sunday led to a lively discussion. Here is a summary of the main take-aways from that discussion.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Should we still standardize non–quantum-safe protocols?</b></p>

<p>
The panelists all agree that it is still viable to standardize non-quantum-safe cryptographic protocols. However, several further remarks were made on this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A focus should be on crypto agility and a path for standardizing a quantum-safe option later on. Useful lessons can be learned from standardizing the non-post-quantum method, enabling faster standardization of pq methods later.</li>
<li>Standardization of non-post-quantum methods sends a mixed signal, and might confuse the consumers of such standards. One suggestion is to add a disclaimer to the standard.</li>
<li>Tasks such as authentication or public key signature schemes with limited lifetime of verification keys can still use non-post-quantum methods for several years. </li>
</ul>
<p>
It was pointed out that approaches like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-davidben-tls-grease-01">GREASE</a> can help to ensure protocols are post-quantum ready, e.g., testing with large, variable-length key and ciphertext fields.
</p>

<p><b>Q: Competition (NIST) vs. community effort (IETF/IRTF) – What are the benefits of these different standardization bodies, and what are the drawbacks?</b></p>

<p>
There is actually no clear separation between the NIST and IETF approaches. Competitions are also a community effort, and sometimes NIST and IETF interact (e.g., EdDSA, some AEAD modes). From the panelists’ experience, industry cares for government standards, but not for IETF ones. One benefit of the IETF is that it enables people from different companies to work together because they have to leave their IPR at the doorstep.
</p>

<p><b>Q: How to incentivize research on ongoing standardization vs. attacking existing standards?</b></p>

<p>
The clear and not very surprising reply was: money. Indeed, companies interested in shipping based on a to-be-standard might ask academics to do security analysis for money. Another remark is that dedicated workshops, like NIST’s or those on TLS 1.3 or QUIC, help to raise more interest in investing research on ongoing standardization efforts, in particular if they publish the results in the form of proceedings. 
</p>

<p><b>Q: Quo vadis SSR: Where to co-locate in the future? Crypto, Security?</b></p>

<p>
From past editions, co-location with larger conferences has proven very effective. Alternating between crypto and security conferences may benefit attracting different audiences. One recommendation was to strengthen the links to standards bodies by considering to co-locate with an IETF meeting. Further, Real World Crypto was mentioned as an attractive event to co-locate with. The panelists also suggested welcoming negative results in the Call for Papers, or “uninteresting” ones that confirm that a standard works as expected, i.e., without finding any interesting attack on it.
